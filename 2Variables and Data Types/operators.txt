-	
*	
/	
%	
++	
--	

relational operator:
==
!=
>  
<
>=
<=

logical operator :
&& and
|| or
! not

Bitwise operator:
&
|
^
~
<<
>>

Misc Operator:
sizeof operator returns the size of a variable.
Condition ? X : Y
,
. (dot) and -> (arrow)[Member operators are used to reference individual members of classes, structures, and unions.]

Casting operators convert one data type to another. For example, int(2.2000) would return 2.
&
Pointer operator & returns the address of a variable. For example &a; will give actual address of the variable.

*
Pointer operator * is pointer to a variable. For example *var; will pointer to a variable var.
